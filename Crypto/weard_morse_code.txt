To be honest this challenge did not require any skill. It was full guesswork.

We get the following cipher :

1101111102120222020120111110101222022221022202022211

We replace the folowing :

1 = - 0 = space 2 = .

So we get :

-- ----- .-. ... . -. ----- - -... ....- ... . ...--

Which is morse code. After decoding it we get the flag.

FLAG : tjctf{m0rsen0tb4se3}
