when PHP needs to compare the string “7 puppies” to the integer 7, PHP will attempt to extract the integer from the string. So this comparison will evaluate to True.
> ("7 puppies" == 7) -> True
But what if the string that is being compared does not contain an integer? The string will then be converted to a “0”. So the following comparison will also evaluate to True:
> ("Puppies" == 0) -> True
